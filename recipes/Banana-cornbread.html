    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Having vegan friends in college forced me to find some recipes that are friendly to their choice if I wanted to
        entertain. This recipe is delicious whether or not you are vegan. I've made it with almond, rice, soy, and
        regular milk and they are all very similar to identical in flavor and consistency.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups cornmeal</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 bananas</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cornmeal, milk, bananas, sugar, vegetable oil, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl
            until batter is smooth; pour into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
