    <h1>Meatless Monday Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="images/meatless.jpeg" alt="This is Meatless Monday lasagna">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We are always looking for recipes to add to our Meatless Monday rotation. Bumping up the protein is important for
        our 3 kids, so adding tofu to the cheese mixture of vegetarian lasagna works great. Use the excess tofu to make
        a high-protein salad dressing.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>4 ounces silken tofu</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, shredded</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced portobello mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 ½ (28 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Toss with
            1 tablespoon olive oil to prevent sticking and add flavor.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix 2 cups mozzarella, ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, tofu, and eggs together in a bowl. Combine
            remaining mozzarella and Parmesan in a smaller bowl.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, heat remaining tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add
            carrots, zucchini, onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pasta sauce
            and spinach; simmer until sauce is heated through and spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Cover the bottom of a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with a little of the vegetable sauce and arrange 1/2
            of the lasagna noodles, overlapping slightly, over top. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese-tofu mixture over
            noodles and 1/2 of the remaining sauce. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, cheese-tofu mixture, and
            sauce. Top with mozzarella-Parmesan mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until bubbly, about 20 minutes more.
            Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing into 8 large squares and serving.</li>
    </ol>
